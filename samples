Listed above is a link to a google drive folder containing a modified comic book scan of Quality Comic's Plastic Man #1.
I got the comic from ComicBookPlus.com, who believe this issue is within the public domain.

I downloaded the original cbz file from comicbookplus.com, converted it to epub and I uploaded it as a sample for this program.

I do not own Plastic Man whatsoever.
